# Tutorial 1: Pre-processing of Sequencing Reads

In this tutorial, you will learn how to pre-process raw sequencing reads by removing adapters, trimming low-quality bases, and filtering out low-quality reads.

**Steps Covered:**
1. Quality assessment using FastQC
2. Adapter trimming using Trimmomatic
3. Quality filtering using Seqtk

Follow along to clean up your raw sequencing reads before moving on to further analysis.
